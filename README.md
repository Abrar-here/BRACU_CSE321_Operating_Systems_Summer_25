## ⚙️ Project Structure

### 🗂️ `CSE321_OS_Project/`
Contains the main project files:
- `mkfs_builder.c`: Initializes the file system, creating the superblock, inodes, and data blocks.
- `mkfs_adder.c`: Adds files into the system by allocating inodes and data blocks, updating metadata and directory structure.
- `.img`: Disk image files generated by the builder.
- `.txt`: Sample input files used in the simulation.

### 📚 `Lab Assignments/`
Contains solutions for various lab assignments, including:
- Shell command exercises.
- C programming tasks related to file operations, process management, and synchronization.

### 🧾 `Theory Assignments/`
Contains theoretical assignments covering topics such as:
- Process concepts and scheduling.
- Inter-process communication (IPC).
- Memory management and storage structures.
